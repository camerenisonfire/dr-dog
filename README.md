# Dr-Dog 🐶

This project is a veterinary portal. It is meant as a playground for practicing Ruby on Rails. 

### Getting Started

To install dependencies
```
bundle install
rails webpacker:install
rails webpacker:install:react

Navigate to `localhost:3000/hello` to verify you see `Greetings: Hello from react-rails.` confirming React is working properly.
